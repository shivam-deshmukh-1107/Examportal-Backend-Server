## Features
### Admin:
- **Category Management:** Admins can add, edit, and delete different categories, such as Programming Quizzes, Quantitative Quizzes, Verbal Quizzes, General Knowledge Quizzes, etc.
- **Quiz Management:** Admins can create quizzes within categories. Each quiz stores multiple questions, but only a specified number of questions are randomly displayed based on the total marks and number of questions input for the quiz.
- **Question Management:** Admins can add, update, and delete questions associated with quizzes.

### User:
- **Category Navigation:** Users can explore different categories of quizzes and select any active quiz to attempt.
- **Quiz Attempt:** After selecting a quiz, users are presented with an instruction page followed by the quiz. The quiz page is divided into two parts: the question display and a timer. The timer is calculated based on the number of questions and total marks for that quiz.
- **Automatic Submission:** Quizzes are automatically submitted when the timer expires.
- **Role-Based Dashboard:** Users are presented with either the Admin Dashboard or User Dashboard based on their authentication roles. Unauthorized users cannot access these dashboards or any associated content.
